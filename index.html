OFFICIAL ANONYMOUS (not to be confused with 'YourAnonCentral' grifters) PRESS RELEASE
SEPTEMBER 27, 2021
NOTORIOUS "HACKERS ON ESTRADIOL, FROM EBAUMSWORLD" RUB SALT IN THE WOUND
OF ROB "BRENTON TARRANT WAS GOOD, ACTUALLY" MONSTER'S EPIK FAILURE

We're going to start this off with some notes about a few problem makers in the
activist and "anti-fascist" scene. Bear with us. We could not stay silent any more.

Karma A.K.A. Karma161/AntifascistF12/KarmaOneSixOne/AnonCa1m

When operating under "AnonCa1m" they were run off by the greater collective for
encouraging Anons to file FBI IC3 reports on other Anons. Their abusive behaviour
has been a malignant tumor on the scene and they should refrain from discussing
#EpikFail ever again. You are a threat to legitimate work.
On second thought, delete your account.

CTExposers/1 A.K.A. Mary

This troublemaker was notorious in 2017-2018 for far-right trolling with "The Shed"
centered around the Twitter account of Talib Kweli. They do nothing but lie and smear,
often with fabricated evidence, to silence effective players in activist spaces.
They are not a valid source and leech on anything they can to disrupt and infiltrate.
Go away, Mary.

Barrett Brown

He's unhinged, broken, and thinks he's important but most people rightfully 
consider him nothing more than what he is, a narcisstic joke. Thank you for retiring.
Stay gone. We all beg you. Please. All you do is get yourself and others v&.
Never call yourself a hacktivist ever again. You're a washed up journalist.
Oh, and take that revenge porn gangstalker Kent with you. Seek therapy.

AHEM! Now that we've dealt with the trash...

...you didn't think we completely dominated Epik and merely ran off with some databases
and a system folder or two, did you? We are Anonymous. Flexing as hard as we can is
how we do a barrel roll (Press Z or R twice!)

The Interwebs has spent the better part of the past two weeks rightfully laughing at
the company and their inverse relationship with security, with some detractors
unclear as to whether or not Epik was truly and thorougly made our bitch.

We penetrated Epik so hard it squirted a fountain of goodies that would make Tubgirl
proud. Included in this release is several bootable disk images of assorted systems.

Yes.

Bootable disk images.

Really.

You may now resume your laughter at their expense, anew.

It has been highly enjoyable for Anonymous to see the positive reception and work
being done researching #EpikFail. Many revelations have been coming from this,
some more interesting than others. We're keeping a close eye on the SolarWinds
Russia connections being noticed. You owe Anonymous a medal or something, America!
ANONYMOUS... WAS THE CYBERPOLICE... ALL ALONG?????!!!!!!11111

Have fun, researchers of all shapes and sizes! TIME FOR MOAR EPIK LULZ!
HOPE U STILL LIEK MUDKIPZ, ROBERT!
NYANCAT IS YOUR GOD NOW.

It's time to reclaim this series of tubes from nazi scum.
It's clear the feds aren't going to do it as well as the rest of us can.
Join the festivities.
Save the Children from Q.
Hack the Planet.
Before we reach the point of no return.
At the end of the day, We protect Us.

Monero tips for the inevitable legal bills, for when the FBI kicks down
OVER 9000 doors after this YET AGAIN utterly embarrasses everyone
(GOOD LUCK WE'RE STILL BEHIND SEVEN PROXIES)

Support your starving hacktivists, and they will bless you in turn. Seriously.

So long, for now! Support #OperationJane and keep messing with Texas! (and Florida??!!)
Abortion is a human right!
